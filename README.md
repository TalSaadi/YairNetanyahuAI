# YairNetanyahuAI
Yair Netanyau AI twitter account based on past tweets and learned by GPT-2 model.

# Background
This generated twitter account is fully managed by a bot that downloaded Yair's last 10,000 tweets and trained a GPT-2 model based on them.
The project is based on Max Woolf's blog and notebook about downloading and training a twitter gpt model.

# Tweets download
The tweets download is based on twint library and max's script that you can find right here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minimaxir/download-tweets-ai-text-gen/master/download_tweets.py

You can find Yair's downloaded tweets at "tweets.csv".

# Training the model
The model is trained using the gpt2-simple library and you can take a look at the code at "gpt-run.py".
To run the script just place a csv file named "tweets.csv" in the same directory and run the script, note that it can take a while.

# Notes
This account is not a political account, it doesn't take any political side, and it's purpose is only to show the capabilities of artificial intelligence.
